zope.testing Package Changelog
=============================

zope.testing version 3.0
------------------------

- Updated the doctest copy with text-file encoding support

- Added logging-level support to loggingsuppport module.

- At verbosity-level 1, dots are not output continuously, without any
  line breaks.

- Improved outout when the inability to tear down a layer causes tests
  to be run in a subprocess.

- Made zope.exception required only if the zope_tracebacks extra is
  requested.


zope.testing version 2.x.y (???)
--------------------------------

- Fix the test coverage. If a module, for example `interfaces`, was in an
  ignored directory/package, then if a module of the same name existed in a
  covered direcotry/package, then it was also ignored there, because the
  ignore cache stored the result by module name and not the filename of the
  module.

zope.testing version 2.0 (2006/01/05)
--------------------------------------

- Corresponds to the verison of the zope.testing package shipped as part of
  the Zope 3.2.0 release.
